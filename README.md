# My Dotfiles

This repo holds my various dotfiles for certain things. You might find helpful
configurations for the following in here:

 * [NeoVim][1]
 * [i3][2]
 * [i3-blocks][3]
 * [Rofi][4]
 * [Nitrogen][5]
 * [Restic][6]

... in addition to other small quality-of-life stuff for bash and a minimal
Linux desktop in general.
